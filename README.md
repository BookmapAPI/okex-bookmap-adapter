# okex-bookmap-adapter
This is an adapter for using bookmap to connect and trade futures using OKEX exchange.

You will need to maven install bookmap bm-l1api.jar and javadoc for this project to compile.  Please take a look at lib/install.sh as an example.

OKEX does not have a test account so you need to have a live account in order to use this adapter.
